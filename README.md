# ITSToolKit
This is the Indian Tech Support Tool Kit "ITSToolKit".
This toolkit uses python 3.10, you can't use any other version because it's using the new match "case" in python 3.10 
Right now I am not able to compile it to a bash file so the tool kit is callable from anywhere. 

Thanks for using and enjoy the tool kit.

Future updates {

Adding an update command or file so you can easily get the newest version of the ToolKit, and don't have to manually download the script and run the Apt installer.
