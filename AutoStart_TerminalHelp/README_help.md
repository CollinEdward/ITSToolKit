The requirements for this toolkit is that you have installed all the requirements in ![ReqForTool](RequrementsForTool.txt)
If they are not installed the toolkit might still work, but not optimal, some functions and commands will be unusable.

With any popular Terminal Emulator, there should be a settings or profile tab, as seen below;

Some Terminal Emulators like the MATE Terminal might have the profile / settings tab in the edit category like show below;

But this tutorial will go over the Konsole- Terminal.

When we open the settings category, and press on "edit current profile", you will see a "general" tab first.
In there, there should be a entry filed with the name of "Command:" and then it can say, "bin/bash", "bin/zsh", "bin/fish" etc.
