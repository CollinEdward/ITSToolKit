This toolkit uses python 3.10, you can't use any other version because it's using the new match "case" in python 3.10 
If you want to use the toolkit by just typing "ITSToolKit" add the ITSToolKit.py and ITSToolKit.sh to /bin/ folder.
You can either do that manually or use the AptInstaller.py or PacmanInstallerReq.py (Depending on Distribution ) file to it automatically for you, and also install all the requirements for the toolkit.
