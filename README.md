# ITSToolKit
This is the Indian Tech Support Tool Kit "ITSToolKit".
This toolkit uses python 3.10, you can't use any other version because it's using the new match "case" in python 3.10 
Right now I am not able to compile it to a bash file so the tool kit wouldbe callable from anywhere. 

Thanks for using and enjoy the tool kit.
